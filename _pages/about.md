I am an Air Quality Scientist at [Aclima](https://www.aclima.io/). My main role involves analyzing the large volume of mobile air pollutant measurements collected by our vehicles, and develop metrics and indicators of pollution intensity at the hyperlocal (block-level) scale.

I first stepped into the field of air pollution in 2012, when I was majoring in Environmental Engineering at my undergraduate program. I was disappointed that a vast majority of the available courses in the department were related to water quality. I thus started reading up on air pollutants, their sources, their mitigation strategies, etc. as a side project.

My hobbies include cycling, swimming, and watching DIY videos on YouTube on a variety of topics e.g., fixing basic issues with computers, maintaining bikes, interesting tutorials on data analysis and visualization techniques, etc.

I very strongly support open-source software, and I believe students should be discouraged from becoming dependent on expensive proprietary software (e.g., MATLAB) for their academic/professional use, if an open-source alternative exists. I would go into details, but I think [this page](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) presents the rationale behind supporting open-source software perfectly. Based on personal experience, here are some recommendations I have for open-source software that are just as good (or in some cases, much better) compared to their proprietary counterparts:

| **Purpose** | **Licensed/Proprietary software** | **Free/Open-source alternative** |
| ---| --- | -- |
| *Scientific writing* | Microsoft Word (very inefficient for this purpose) | [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) |
| *Non-scientific writing* | Microsoft Word | [Libre Writer](https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/writer/) |
| *Presentations* | Microsoft PowerPoint | [Libre Impress](https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/impress/) |
| *Spreadsheets* | Microsoft Excel | [Libre Calc](https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/calc/) |
| *Programming and data analysis* | MATLAB, Igor Pro | [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/) |
| *Relational database management* | Microsoft Access | [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/), [DB Browser](https://sqlitebrowser.org/), [LibreOffice Base](https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/base/) |
| *Geospatial analysis* | ArcGIS | [Q-GIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/) |
| *GUI-based scientific plotting* | Grapher, Origin, Igor Pro, etc. | [Veusz](https://veusz.github.io/) |
| *Figure editing* | Photoshop, Illustrator, etc. | [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) |
| *Operating system* | macOS, Windows | Linux distributions: [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop), [Mint](https://linuxmint.com/)|

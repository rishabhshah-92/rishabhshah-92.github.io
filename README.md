Welcome to the Git respository behind [my personal webpage](https://rishabhshah-92.github.io/)!

This webpage is built using a Github Pages template for academic websites. This template was forked (then detached) by [Stuart Geiger](https://github.com/staeiou) from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), which is Â© 2016 Michael Rose and released under the MIT License. See LICENSE.md.

Here are the overall appearance changes I have made to this repo after forking it:
- I changed the entire webpage to a dark theme by making changes to various CSS files within the repo. You can probably find these changes in the `diff` versions of my many, many commits (I am not a very good Git user, clearly!)
- I changed the Masthead color to Bianchi Green (hex #b2ffff), dedicated to my Bianchi road bike.
- I added a Mastodon icon and link to the list of social media accounts in the left sidebar.
- I embedded my CV in the webpage, instead of having it open in a separate tab.

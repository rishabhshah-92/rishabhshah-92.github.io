## Abstract
We performed more than a year of mobile, 1 Hz measurements of lung-deposited surface area (LDSA, the surface area of 20â€“400 nm diameter particles, deposited in alveolar regions of lungs) and optically assessed fine particulate matter (PM2.5), black carbon (BC), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in central London. We spatially correlated these pollutants to two urban emission sources: major roadways and restaurants. We show that optical PM2.5 is an ineffective indicator of tailpipe emissions on major roadways, where we do observe statistically higher LDSA, BC, and NO2.
